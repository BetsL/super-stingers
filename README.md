# super-stingers
*NEW* Classroom Site.  Yay!

As a teacher, I believe that formulating content is part substance, part presentation. I wanted a new site that would catch the eye, but not overwhelm users with superflous information - enabling them to quickly locate and access helpful resources. I also wanted the site to tie in to our school 'Stinger Bee' motif while preserving subtlety; the bee theme has been done and overdone ;) I crafted this stained glass model to align with those thoughts and considerations.
